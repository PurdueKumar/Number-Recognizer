Program description:

This is exercise 4 of the coursera machine learning program. A beginner learning exercise
that utilizes the MNIST handwritten digits database. I included this because I find it 
fascinating how a computer to learn to recognize digits and characters. The outline for
the functions was written by the course instructor with most of the mathematical and linear
algebra expression missing. I was provided with the ex4.pdf that gave me the mathematical
expression which I had to convert to MATLAB code. This exercise also gave me a introduction
to how neural networks functioned and later introduced me to backpropogation which I would
use in my Tic-Tac-Toe AI
